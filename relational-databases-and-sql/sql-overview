in this chapter you will learn how to

discuss the originals of SQL
demo syntax features of core SQL, letter cases, spaces, quotation marks and semi-colons

SQL - stands for Structured Query Language, the programming language used to communicate with database to perform operations

in SQL, the official term to define a complete command is a STATEMENT, but normally we use QUERY to refer to any SQL statement.

Very IMPORTANT to have basic foundational knowledge of standard SQL because the world revolves around data and you will benefit alot just by learning how to script for data manipulation.

Syntax - refers to ordering of text that can be recognized by SQL

below is an example of SQL syntax:

SELECT field1, field1, field3
FROM table1
WHERE criteria
ORDER BY field1, field2;

take note that SQL syntax requirements are VERY STRICT so be sure to constantly refer to documentation. MOST SQL statements require the use of semi-colons at every end of statement. LINE BREAKS and INDENTS are useful for readability and formatting.

an example:

CREATE TABLE `Client` (
    ClientId CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    BirthDate DATE NULL,
    Address VARCHAR(256) NULL,
    City VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    StateAbbr CHAR(2) NULL,
    PostalCode VARCHAR(10) NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY fk_Client_StateAbbr (StateAbbr)
        REFERENCES State(StateAbbr)
);

LETTER CASES are useful for formatting, it is reccomended to capitalize keywords in CAPS.

COMMAS are used to seperate objects in a series.
SPACES are required for every logical word in a statement.
QUOTATION MARKS can either be '' or "" as long as used in pairs
SPELLING just take note !
