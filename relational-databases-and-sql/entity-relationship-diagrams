in this chapter you will learn how to

create an ERD that includes tables, field and relationships identified by the end of database normalization process
include appropriate meta data about database components, like PK and FK, data types and nullability

using ERDs help us to identify the tables and field the database will have. ERDs are a visual representation of the database structure that:

helps to identify places where proposed structure may not work, identifying these problems during the design phase will help avoid problems later when doing SQL scripting.

allows teammates to see database structure, quickly identify fields and tables.

presents a single, condensed representation of the structure, allowing for more efficient SQL scripting


available tools to construct ERD - draw.io and ERDPlus

a well designed ERD consist of the following:

tables required by the database, including the name of each table
a list of fields contained in each table
metadata of each field such as name, data type, and NOT NULL or etc.
identification of all PKs and FKs
entity relationship between each table in the database


ERDs are important tools in RDBs because they provide a visualisation of database structures. They are useful throughout all phases of the database administration process, from creation to retrieval. Refer to lucidchart's page : what is an entity relationship diagram.
