--Create a variable named TEXT with the value "The number is "

	#!/bin/bash
	
	read $INPUT_STRING
	echo "The number is $INPUT_STRING"	

--Write a for loop that prints numbers 1-25 after printing the value of TEXT each time.
	
	#!/bin/bash

	for i in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25
	do
		echo "Looping the numbers $i"
	done
	
--Run the same command, this time redirecting the output to a file named forloop.out.

	forLoop.sh > forloop.out	

--Write a sed command that creates a new output file from forloop.out where instead of saying "the number is ", it will now say "the number is not ". Name the file forloop2.out

	sed '/\[The number is\]/a not' forloop.out

--Try running the following if statement to get familiar with it:

i=1
if(( $i==1 ))
then
echo "i is equal to 1"
elif(($i==2))
then
echo "i is equal to 2"
else
echo "i is neither 1 or 2"
fi

--Change the value of i to be something not 1 or 2 and check that the statement works again.

	works when changing i=3 >.

--Create a variable of today's date named TODAY in the format of DD.MM.YYYY.

	TODAY_DATE= date +"%d-%m-%y"

--Create another variable named GENDATE that has the command to generate and store the same date.

	GENDATE= date +"%d-%m-%y" > gendate.out

--Create a file named output.log with todayâ€™s date as an extension using the variable you just created.

	GENDATE= date +%d-%m-%y
	LOGFILE= ~/Users/jeff/Documents/Github/wiley-sre-training/$USER.man.$TODAY.log
